ðŸ”Œ API Integration

This frontend consumes the StacksPlays Backend API:

GET /api/games/:id â†’ Fetch game status & countdown timer.

POST /api/games/:id/reset â†’ Reset game schedule (admin-only).

GET /api/leaderboard?period=season â†’ Fetch leaderboard data.

POST /api/leaderboard/submit â†’ Submit player score (protected/admin).


Ensure the backend is running before launching the frontend.

---

ðŸ›¡ Security & Best Practices

Secrets (API keys, admin tokens) are stored in .env (excluded via .gitignore).

Admin-only features (like scheduling games) require proper role from AuthContext.

Game state (open/closed) is fetched from backend to ensure consistency across all clients.

---

[ ] Connect with Leather Wallet for blockchain login.

[ ] On-chain leaderboard storage (Stacks smart contracts).

[ ] Add multiplayer casino-style games.

[ ] Live chat integration for community interaction.
